This program would require the user to input a melody as
well as the key of the melody that it is in, and whether 
its major or minor. It would use this info to suggest 
chord progressions that can then be used to create a 
instrumental track. 

If the note submitted does not belong in a certain key 
it will return false.

If the user inputs the key of G, in major, it could suggest 
using the chords/ progression (Bm, D, Em, C) or (G, Em, C, D).

If the user inputs the key of G, in minor, it could suggest
using the chords/ progression (Gm, Eb, Bb) or (Gm, Cm, Gm, Dm).

I would use a database to store the possible progressions for
each key.
